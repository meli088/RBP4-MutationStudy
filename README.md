# RBP4-MutationStudy

## Description

**RBP4-MutationStudy** is a bioinformatics project focused on analyzing mutations in the **Retinol-Binding Protein 4 (RBP4)** gene in Siberian tigers. The study aims to understand the structural and functional consequences of identified mutations in the RBP4 sequence, which may explain symptoms of vitamin A deficiency despite adequate dietary intake.

## Background

Siberian tigers in the study displayed symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. A 783 base pair mRNA sequence, identified as part of the **RBP4** gene, was significantly overexpressed in liver biopsies. RBP4 is crucial for retinol (vitamin A) transport in the bloodstream. The mutations found in this sequence might affect RBP4's ability to transport retinol efficiently, leading to dysfunction despite sufficient vitamin A intake.

## Methodology

### 1. BLAST Analysis

- **Objective**: Identify homologs of the 783 bp mRNA sequence.
- **Tools**: NCBI BLAST, SWISSPROT.

### 2. Multiple Sequence Alignment

- **Objective**: Compare the RBP4 sequence from Siberian tigers with other mammals.
- **Tools**: CLUSTAL OMEGA.

### 3. Homology Modeling

- **Objective**: Predict the 3D structure of RBP4 with identified mutations.
- **Tools**: Swiss Model, PyMOL.

### 4. Mutation Analysis

- **Objective**: Identify mutations and their potential impacts on RBP4's structure and function.
- **Tools**: PyMOL, Structural Models.

## Results

Identified mutations in the RBP4 sequence of Siberian tigers include amino acid substitutions that may affect protein stability and retinol-binding capacity. Particularly, the **A46I\*** mutation appears crucial, increasing hydrophobicity and altering the retinol-binding pocket, potentially disrupting vitamin A transport function.

## Conclusions

The study suggests that mutations in the **RBP4** gene could explain vitamin A deficiency symptoms observed in the studied Siberian tigers. However, further experimental studies are required to validate these findings and evaluate the exact functional impacts of the identified mutations.
